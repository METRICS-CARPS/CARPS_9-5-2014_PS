## Article ID: 9-5-2014 PS

For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section of Experiment 1.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Figures 2, 3, and 4 summarize results for all age groups
and traits; higher percentages of expected responses (i.e.,
those predicted on the basis of prior dataâ€”e.g., that
trustworthy faces would be identified as nice and untrustworthy
faces as mean) indicate stronger consensus. Combined, all four age groups showed significant consensus
compared with chance (50%) when identifying
faces as mean or nice (93%; Fig. 2), strong or not strong
(85%; Fig. 3), and smart or not smart (76%; Fig. 4).
Critically, all age groups attributed all three traits with
significant consensus, ps < .001, ds > 1.08. However, an
analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant main
effect of age group, F(3, 236) = 17.91, p < .001. Although
3- to 4-year-olds responded with robust and adult like
consensus (72% across all traits), they were less consistent
than 5- to 6-year-olds (81%), 7- to 10-year-olds (88%),
and adults (89%). One-way ANOVAs followed by post hoc tests with Sidak corrections for multiple comparisons
were used to analyze age differences for each trait. These
analyses revealed that when attributing both trustworthiness
and dominance, 3- to 4-year-olds were less consistent
than all other age groups (all ps < .01, ds > 0.59),
which exhibited equivalent consistency (all ps > .23, ds <
0.40).
